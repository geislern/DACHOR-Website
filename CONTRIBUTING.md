## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Bug reports should help to understand the issue, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

Before creating bug reports, please check open issues as you might find out that you don't need to create a new one.
When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report).
Fill out any applicable template to help us resolve issues faster.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new
> issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as GitLab issues.
Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. When listing steps, **don't
  just say what you did, but explain how you did it**.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or copy/pasteable snippets, which you
  use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use Markdown code blocks.
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that
  behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots** which show you following the steps and demonstrate the problem.
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and
  share more information using the guidelines below.

Provide more context by answering these questions:

* **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating) or was this always a problem?
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which
  conditions it normally happens.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section describes submitting an enhancement suggestion, including completely new features and minor improvements to
existing functionality.

Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check the software does not provide this functionality already or there
is already an open issue suggesting it, as you might find out that you don't need to create a new one. When you are
creating an enhancement suggestion,
please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion). Fill in any applicable
templates, including the steps that you imagine you would take if the feature you're requesting existed.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as Github issues. Create an issue on that repository and provide the following
information:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those
  examples, as Markdown code blocks.
* **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.
* **Include screenshots** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part of the software which the
  suggestion is related to.
* **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to users.
